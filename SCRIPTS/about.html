				Personally, the value of knowledges and skills are relative. For example, there are not many people with artificial intelligence skills, which are  really useful, but after 20 years probably it will be standard and probably its value will go down. In a global capitalist society, it seems that only what is absolutely valueable is "muscle".
				I think that there are two ways of how to leave value in such a society.
				The first is to explore the frontier and realize what no one could do. For example, iMac.
				Second, be familiar with numerous fields and demarcate them. Is "horizontal thinking of withered technology" close to that? For example, at team laboratories, integration of architecture and digital is being planned. Even Steve Jobs says that without knowledge of calligraphy field, we could not implement beautiful fonts on Mac. In other words, is not it all-rounder that all specialists are required?

				This group's name "Sci-Pedia" stands for Scienta Encyclopedia (Scientia Encyclopedia). Scientia is the Latin word that became the source of Science, meaning "knowledge". I think that it is the perfect naming for us who live in the science edition of Wikipedia, science science WWW ww I just decided to make a group.

				I think that each area and interested knowledge should be brought together and used for extension of one's own.
